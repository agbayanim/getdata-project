=====================

Experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, data captured was 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
